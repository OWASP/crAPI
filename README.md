# crAPI

**c**ompletely **r**idiculous **API** (crAPI) will help you to understand the
ten most critical API security risks. crAPI is vulnerable by design, but you'll
be able to safely run it to educate/train yourself.

crAPI is modern, built on top of a microservices architecture. When time has

know more about crAPI, please check [crAPI's overview][overview].

## QuickStart Guide

### Docker

You'll need to have Docker installed and running on your host system.

#### Using prebuilt images
You can use prebuilt images generated by our CI workflow.

1. Clone crAPI repository

   - Linux Machine

   ```
       $ git clone [REPOSITORY-URL]
   ```

   - Windows Machine

   ```
       $ git clone [REPOSITORY-URL] --config core.autocrlf=input
   ```


2. Start crAPI
    - To use the latest stable version.

      - Linux Machine
      
      ```
      git checkout main
      
      VERSION=latest docker-compose -f deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml --compatibility up -d
      ```

      - Windows Machine
      
      ```
      git checkout main
      
      setx VERSION latest && docker-compose -f deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml --compatibility up -d
      ```

    - To use the latest development version

      - Linux Machine
      
      ```
      git checkout develop
      
      VERSION=develop docker-compose -f deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml --compatibility up -d
      ```

      - Windows Machine
      
      ```
      git checkout develop
      
      setx VERSION develop && docker-compose -f deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml --compatibility up -d
      ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:8888`

**Note**: All emails are sent to mailhog service by default and can be checked on
`http://localhost:8025`
You can change the smtp configuration if required however all emails with domain **example.com** will still go to mailhog.


#### Build it yourself

1. Clone crAPI repository

   - Linux Machine

   ```
       $ git clone [REPOSITORY-URL]
   ```

   - Windows Machine

   ```
       $ git clone [REPOSITORY-URL] --config core.autocrlf=input
   ```

2. Build all docker images

   - Linux Machine

   ```
   $ deploy/docker/build-all.sh
   ```

   - Windows Machine

   ```
   $ call "%cd%\deploy\docker\build-all.bat"
   ```

3. Start crAPI
   ```
   $ docker-compose -f deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml --compatibility up -d
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:8888`

**Note**: All emails are sent to mailhog service by default and can be checked on
`http://localhost:8025`
You can change the smtp configuration if required however all emails with domain **example.com** will still go to mailhog.

If you would like to deploy on kubernetes we have sample k8s configs already
created. Check [the setup instructions][setup-k8s] for more details.

### Vagrant

This option allows you to run crAPI within a virtual machine, thus isolated from
your system. You'll need to have [Vagrant] and, for example [VirtualBox]
installed.

1. Clone crAPI repository
   ```
   $ git clone [REPOSITORY-URL]
   ```
2. Start crAPI Virtual Machine
   ```
   $ cd deploy/vagrant && vagrant up
   ```
3. Visit `http://192.168.33.20`

**Note**: All emails are sent to mailhog service and can be checked on
`http://192.168.33.20:8025`

Once you're done playing with crAPI, you can remove it completely from your
system running the following command from the repository root directory

```
$ cd deploy/vagrant && vagrant destroy
```
