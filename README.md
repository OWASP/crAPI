# crAPI

**c**ompletely **r**idiculous **API** (crAPI) will help you to understand the
ten most critical API security risks. crAPI is vulnerable by design, but you'll
be able to safely run it to educate/train yourself.

crAPI is modern, built on top of a microservices architecture. When time has
come to buy your first car, sign up for an account and start your journey. To
know more about crAPI, please check [crAPI's overview][overview].

## QuickStart Guide

### Docker

You'll need to have Docker installed and running on your host system.

#### Using prebuilt images
You can use prebuilt images generated by our CI workflow.

 - To use the latest stable version.

      - Linux Machine

      ```
      curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWASP/crAPI/main/deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml

      docker-compose pull
      
      docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --compatibility up -d
      ```

      - Windows Machine

      ```
      curl.exe -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWASP/crAPI/main/deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml

      docker-compose pull
      
      docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --compatibility up -d
      ```

  - To use the latest development version

      - Linux Machine

      ```
      curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWASP/crAPI/develop/deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml
      
      VERSION=develop docker-compose pull 
      
      VERSION=develop docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --compatibility up -d
      ```

      - Windows Machine

      ```
      curl.exe -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWASP/crAPI/develop/deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml

      set "VERSION=develop"

      docker-compose pull
      
      docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --compatibility up -d
      ```

**Note**: All emails are sent to mailhog service by default and can be checked on
[http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025)
You can change the smtp configuration if required however all emails with domain **example.com** will still go to mailhog.

### Vagrant

This option allows you to run crAPI within a virtual machine, thus isolated from
your system. You'll need to have [Vagrant] and, for example [VirtualBox]
installed.

1. Clone crAPI repository
   ```
   $ git clone [REPOSITORY-URL]
   ```
2. Start crAPI Virtual Machine
   ```
   $ cd deploy/vagrant && vagrant up
   ```
3. Visit [http://192.168.33.20](http://192.168.33.20)

**Note**: All emails are sent to mailhog service and can be checked on
[http://192.168.33.20:8025](http://192.168.33.20:8025)

Once you're done playing with crAPI, you can remove it completely from your
system running the following command from the repository root directory

```
$ cd deploy/vagrant && vagrant destroy
```
